# Personal Resume

Repository created for hosting publicly my resume, in various formats.

### Direct link to resume

A nice way to provide direct link to a static file here on GitHub is the following:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[user]/[repository]/[branch]/[filepath]

So for example, if I want to share a direct link to my european format resume, the link would be:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/galassie/resume/master/EuropeanFormat/CV-Europass-20170929-Galassi-IT.pdf
